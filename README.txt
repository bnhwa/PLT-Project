For this deliverable, we do not have a codegen yet. But everything else works and you can test them 
by compiling with "ocamlbuild xirtam.native" and run "./xirtam.native -a/-s hello.txt"

Most of our code right now is a modified version of the microC.
We adapted the microC code to work with our own language.

For the test script, we'd like to cite the past project autoMATic as adaptation.
